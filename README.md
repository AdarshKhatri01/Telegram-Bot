If you want to *deploy LLM (Large Language Models) locally, **free hosting is quite difficult* because:  

1. *LLM models are very resource-intensive* (require at least 2GB+ RAM).  
2. *Free hosting services (Render, Railway, Replit) have limited CPU/GPU resources.*  
3. *Free GPU services (Google Colab, Kaggle) are not stable for running bots continuously.*
